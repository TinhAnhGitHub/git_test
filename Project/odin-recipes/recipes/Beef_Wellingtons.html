        <h1>Chef John's Individual Beef Wellingtons</h1>
        <p>Enjoy these individual beef Wellingtons with no regrets and no second thoughts! 
            Perfectly cooked filet mignon topped with a rich, savory mushroom pate is wrapped in 
            a crispy pastry crust and served on top of a buttery pastry base for a 1-2 punch that's 
            hard to beat. Serve as-is or with a simple, brown pan sauce.

            <h2>Ingredients for the Mushroom Duxelles:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>10 large brown mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
                <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper to tast</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to tast</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white win</li>
                <li>2 ounces pate</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Step:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>Melt butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt; cook and stir until 
                        well browned and caramelized, about 5 minutes. They will be wet and soggy at 
                        first but will dry out.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        Add shallots and cook until they soften up and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. 
                        Add black pepper, cayenne, and white wine. Stir until wine evaporates, about 1 minute. 
                        Turn off the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool to room temperature
